# Solang-series

Hey Solana mates Gm,

Ever tried building on Solana? It can be a bit tough, right? We've all been in that spot – starting a Solana program in Rust and then getting stuck on where to begin with Solana program development.

Introducing the "**solang-series**" – a carefully put-together set of articles to guide you through the world of Solana network development. We're blending the Solang compiler and Solidity programming language to explore how Solidity program fit into the Solana ecosystem. Our goal is to make this journey easy for developers, giving you a smooth way to dive into Solana development.

No more stress about Rust macros! In the "solang-series," you'll learn how to create Solana programs using Solidity.

Our mission is clear – help developers switch from Ethereum's EVM world to the exciting Solana realm.

We're excited to hear your thoughts on our "solang-series" tutorial project. Let's work together to make it super easy for EVM developers to transition to Solana. Your feedback and involvement keep us moving ahead on this awesome journey.
