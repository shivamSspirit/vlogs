### Things about project-based programs

* In this climate, education and skill-building are both things that shouldn’t have a _stop_ point. The good news is that thanks to the increasing availability of online short-term project-based learning, it’s easier than ever for workers to add to their arsenal of skills

* Project Based Learning is a teaching method in which students learn by actively engaging in real-world and personally meaningful projects.

* Project-based learning can help provide training that is focused on teaching critical thinking — figuring out all the steps needed to create a solution.

### Scenario about these approach to today's learning

* For example, a problem-based learning project could involve students pitching ideas and creating their own business plans to solve a societal need. Students could work independently or in a group to conceptualize, design, and launch their innovative product in front of classmates and community leaders.
**while** degree based long programs are focus on entire learning systems of their courses and subcourses. after all some learners are distracted from their learning path and not gain individual skill to perfrom in workplace environment.

* we’re likely looking at a future where our skills are more important than the degrees hold by us.

* Also, it’s important to note that GPAs and transcripts aren’t always an indication of ability. For example, certain skills, like coding, are a _can_ or _can’t_ scenario. It doesn’t matter where or how you learned them, it just matters that you can execute effectively and deliver the desired results.

### Short term project-based learning is helpful for these reasons

1. #### **_Cultivate curiosity_**

* Project-based learning requires you to ask questions and seek answers both independently and collaboratively. Curiosity is at the heart of **deep learning**, which drives _project-based_ learning.

* Large projects frequently require a good amount of research. Answering the who, what, why, and how is all part of the research process, so as a project-based learner you’re encouraged to get curious and find out as much information as possible. This helps you to ensure you have a complete picture of what you’re doing.

2. #### **_Hone non-technical skills_**
 
* When you engage in project-based learning, you need to employ **critical thinking**, **communication**, **collaboration**, and **problem-solving** in difficult situations — all of which are valuable and sought-after skills.

* While employers are looking for candidates who possess strong technical skills, non-technical skills are also critical to success in any role. Being able to cite experience and examples of project-based learning shows recruiters that you have what it takes to be a **well-rounded** employee.

3. #### **_prepare students for actual workplace scenario_**

* We all know it’s one thing to learn something in theory, but quite another to actually put it into practice. Project-based learning is focused on providing hands-on opportunities to understand the concepts you’re learning and how to apply them.

* Think about a project to build an app. You may have learned the steps needed to build the app, but unless you’ve actually executed a project like that, you won’t necessarily know what the possible pitfalls are, how to identify potential issues, or how to resolve them. Project-based learning means you’ve actually done the work and will have valuable lessons learned to share with potential employers and to apply in future roles.

4. #### **_provide proof of understanding_**

* It’s far easier for potential employees to demonstrate a solid understanding of a concept when they can provide real-world examples. Project-based learning allows you to build a portfolio that shows your competence.

### Benifits of short term learning programs

* Light on the pocket: They are cheaper than full-time courses and many offer top-quality training, which helps one stay on top of the game.

* Short-term courses can give one a competitive edge and also help develop oneself personally. These are especially useful when a working professional is stuck and doesn’t know what his/her next career move is.
